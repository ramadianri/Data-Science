# Data-Science
Repository containing copies of my data science journey, including notes and projects completed by me for **portfolio** purposes.

## Contents
- [Kaggle Competition - House Prices, Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/ramadianri/Data-Science/blob/master/house_prices.ipynb): With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, I predict the final price of each home by using Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- [Kaggle Competition - Predict Future Sales](https://github.com/ramadianri/Data-Science/blob/master/predict_future_sales.ipynb): This challenge serves as final project for the ”How to win a data science competition” Coursera course. The dataset consist of daily sales data, provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. I predict total sales for every product and store in the next month by using XGBRegressor model.
- [Loan Prediction Problem](https://github.com/ramadianri/Data-Science/blob/master/loan_prediction_problem.ipynb): In this dataset, we need to predict whether or not to approve a loan based on the past information of the person. This is a classification problem and I use machine learning, Decision Tree Classifier model, to make the prediction.
- [Red Wine Quality](https://github.com/ramadianri/Data-Science/blob/master/red_wine_quality.ipynb): The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese ”Vinho Verde” wine. I use Random Forest Classifier to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine ’good’.
